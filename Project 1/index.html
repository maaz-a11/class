          <h2>Angel of Mercy</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Abdul Sattar Edhi</b> (1 January 1928 – 8 July 2016) was a
            Pakistani philanthropist, ascetic, and humanitarian who founded the
            Edhi Foundation, which operates the largest volunteer ambulance
            service in the world. He was born in Bantva, British India (now in
            Gujarat, India), and moved to Karachi, Pakistan after partition in
            1947. Known for his selfless dedication to the needy, Edhi
            established various social services, including orphanages, homeless
            shelters, rehabilitation centers, and medical facilities across
            Pakistan. Edhi was revered for his humble lifestyle and his mission
            to serve humanity, regardless of religion or race, earning him the
            title of "Angel of Mercy" in Pakistan.
